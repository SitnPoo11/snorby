## Description

Snorby is a ruby on rails web application for network security monitoring that interfaces with current popular intrusion detection systems (Snort, Suricata and Saga). The basic fundamental concepts behind Snorby are simplicity, organization and power. The project goal is to create a free, open source and highly competitive application for network monitoring for both private and enterprise use.

# Helpful Commands

You can open the rails console at anytime and interact with the Snorby environment. Below are a few helpful commands that may be useful:

 * Open the rails console by typing `rails c` in the Snorby root directory
 * You should never really need to run the below commands. They are all available within the
	Snorby interface but documented here just in case.

**Snorby Worker**

	Snorby::Worker.stop      # Stop The Snorby Worker
	Snorby::Worker.start     # Start The Snorby Worker
	Snorby::Worker.restart   # Restart The Snorby Worker

**Snorby Cache Jobs**
	
	# This will manually run the sensor cache job - pass true or false for verbose output
	Snorby::Jobs::SensorCacheJob.new(true).perform`

	# This will manually run the daily cache job - once again passing true or false for verbose output
	Snorby::Jobs::DailyCacheJob.new(true).perform

	# Clear All Snorby Cache - You must pass true to this method call for confirmation.
	Snorby::Jobs.clear_cache

	# If the Snorby worker is running this will start the cache jobs and set the run_at time for the current time.
	Snorby::Jobs.run_now!
